                  <p>By accepting these terms, you're agreeing to utilize the speech recognition feature integrated into our system. This acceptance entails granting permission for the system to access your microphone to capture speech input. We assure you that your privacy is of utmost importance to us. To safeguard your data, the system adopts a local storage approach, ensuring that your speech input remains solely within the confines of your device's storage. This means that your data isn't transmitted over the internet or to any external servers, mitigating potential privacy concerns associated with data transfer.</p>

                    <p>Moreover, we prioritize the security of your data. Industry-standard security measures are employed to protect your speech input data stored locally, preventing unauthorized access or disclosure. However, we recognize the importance of user choice and privacy control. Thus, if you prefer not to grant access to your microphone or if privacy concerns arise, you have the option to decline. By choosing to decline, the system refrains from accessing your microphone for speech input, respecting your privacy preferences.</p>
                    
                    <p>Your decision to decline access to your microphone will be honored, and the system will not prompt you further for speech input unless you opt to re-enable the feature. We believe in empowering users to make informed choices regarding their privacy. Even if you decline microphone access, you can still interact with other system features that do not necessitate speech input. Rest assured, whether you accept or decline, your privacy remains paramount, and your preferences are respected.</p>
